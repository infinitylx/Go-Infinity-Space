[^1]: From Ovid: "Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit," which means, "By adding little to little there will be a great heap." Which, I think, is applyed to modern programming. Where you just bring together different component and get something new. Some kind of transfortamion from quantity to a new level of quality.
