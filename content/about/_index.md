## Biography

I'm Vladyslav Merezhko (Владислав Мережко) and this is my space.

*"Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit."*[^1]

This blog is about Me and my \*nix.

Programming is my hobby and work. I write mostly in Python, but My recent passion is Go-lang. Also I done some work in Java.

I prefer simplicity over complexity. The perfect solution can't be complex.

*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."* (c) Leonardo da Vinci

Another side of my interests is traveling. You can find some articles and photos about my travels in blog.

Also, you can *hire* me.

[^1]: From Ovid: "Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit," which means, "By adding little to little there will be a great heap." Which, I think, is applyed to modern programming. Where you just bring together different component and get something new. Some kind of transfortamion from quantity to a new level of quality.
