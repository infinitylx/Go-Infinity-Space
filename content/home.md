My name is Vladyslav (Владислав) and this is my space.

I write about programming related stuff and places I visit.

Under construction is a section dedicated to books. As a start I will post a list of books gathered by Sergey Kryzhanowsky during his week as @backenddeveloper on twitter. (I have permission to do so 😉)

Next is to gather a full library with reviews.
