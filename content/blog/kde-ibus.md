# KDE no input in the interface. 

As it turns out this is all falt of the **ibus**. 

Thanks to some @Prunkton on reddit for finally giving a clue about what is wrong with it. 

So, after a long of time not using Linux I was forced to use it (at work, so I do not regret). Install Ubuntu with some wayland/unity. Everything worked somehow. There I setup different keyboard layout and how to switch it. 

But I was tired of unity/gnome uglyness and install KDE. As KDE have its own keyboard setup thing I kinda hated to see some rudiment from unity to switch layout. Also those two would conflict. 

So every time I close it. AND EXACTLY THIS CAUSES THIS ISSUE. So instead of close just set to hide in settings of this ibus thing.
