## Allways answer.

To the e-mails where you are in the "to:" field.

Like always! No exceptions.

## Allways answer in 2 hours. 

If you can't provide solution just provide estimations — when you will be able to work on solution if at all. 

The worst thing you can do — is to keep silence. Which creates frustration. Poeple always fear of unknown.

## Provide all needed informatio.

To create solution and get into context. Put links, attach files, etc. 

## Use positive or neutral lexicon 

Negative only produce anger. Not a solution. The best way for problems discussions is to provide few solutions. 

And on the end I want to add qoute from gen. Mad dog Mattis: „Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.”
