## Allways answer.

To the e-mails where you are in the "to:" field.

Like always! No exceptions.

## Allways answer in 2 hours. 

If you can't provide solution just provide estimations — when you will be able to work on solution if at all. 

The worst thing you can do — is to keep silence. Which creates frustration. Poeple always fear of unknown.

## Provide all needed informatio.

To create solution and get into context. Put links, attach files, etc. 

## Use positive or neutral lexicon 

Negative only produce anger. Not a solution. The best way for problems discussions is to provide few solutions. 

## Some useful abbreviations

To use in subject and create shorter more informative messages.

    *WAS:* the subject was changed. Not an abbreviation, but the word "was" (past tense of "be"). Also written as "Was: " and "was: ". It indicates that the subject has changed since the previous email, e.g., "Do you know a good babysitter? (WAS: What should we do this weekend?)". This prevents confusion on the part of the recipient and avoids accusations of threadjacking.
    
    *OT:* off topic. Used within an email thread to indicate that this particular reply is about a different topic than the rest of the thread, in order to avoid accusations of threadjacking.
    
    *EOM* – end of message. Also written as "Eom" or "eom". Used at the end of the subject when the entire content of the email is contained in the subject and the body remains empty. This saves the recipient's time because they then do not have to open the message.
    
    *WFH* – Working from Home. Used in the subject line or body of the email.
    
    *1L* – One Liner. Used at the beginning of the subject when the subject of the email is the only text contained in the email. This prefix indicates to the reader that it is not necessary to open the email. E.g., "1L: WFH today"
    
    *NONB* – Non-business. Used at the beginning of the subject when the subject of the email is not related to business. This prefix indicates to the reader that the email is not about a work related or endorsed topic.
