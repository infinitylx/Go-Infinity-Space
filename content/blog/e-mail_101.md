## Always answer

To the e-mails where you are in the "to:" field.

Like always! No exceptions.

## Always answer in 2 hours

If you can't provide solution just provide estimations — when you will be able to work on solution if at all.

The worst thing you can do — is to keep silence. Which creates frustration. People always fear of unknown.

## Provide all needed information

To create solution and get into context. Put links, attach files, etc.

## Use positive or neutral lexicon

Negative only produce anger. Not a solution. The best way for problems discussions is to provide few solutions.

## Some useful abbreviations
