So I came up with this idia to write post mortem on my last few places of work. A retro if you will. 
All company names are changed and purely fictional.

# Ability

Lets call this small startup from York. 

At first I was surpriced with code base -- how that shitty code can be running on production. 

Just how??? 

After a few quarters reports and a few good compensations I start to realise that code quality and production or startup revenue have little in common. If code is not something start selling is.

Huge problem with with this startup was undocumented processes. There were a few so called *"colleagues"* with all the knowelegde if you belive it.

One more problem is incompetent idiot hired as Tech VP. After that hire lots of people left by the way.

No documentation is not an option. Fuck you every one of you who don't do documentation.

Code quality and no or little in common with revenue -- think again!! Company starts to layoff personal. So after all code quality is some kind of a red flag.

# PAM 

Another company that deserves to be mentions is monstreous corporation of evil (no, not #oogle). 

That is outstuff huge corpo. To be survive there all you need to do is to stuck you tongue into manager's ass. The deeper you get, the higher you will be promoted. Developers there were of mediocrite knoweledge or less.

In general environment is **very** unhealthy there. When you enter office you see doomed faces on zoomby like personal. Despite your mood you start to getting loose your soul and happines. It's like some kind of corporate succub starts to suck all your life energy. 

You get like line manager, orthogonal manager, project manager, square manager, and peoples manager. All of them wants some thing from you. So much asses to lick, so you don't know where to start. Frustration manager is what next they should introduce. Coz what can solve a problem with too many managers? -- One more manager to manage managers. Then repeat. Until heating death of universe came.

Also those orthogonal manager is most misirable persons -- lowest rank with little or no real power but huge ambitions. The only way for them to feel power is to macromanage your self --suffering-- developmnet plan.

So, as always in such a big copro everything depends -- on which project you get, which ass you start licking first, how often so called colleagues will whistle blow you (and they will soon or later) and etc.
