Правила игры в Кости Балдура:

Ba/dur's Bones. Baidu r's Bones is a popular dice game in
the taverns of Baldur's Gate. Each player requires several
six-sided dice. The rules are as follows:
• Each player puts the agreed ante in the pot.
• Each player rolls three dice. Play then proceeds clockwise
around the table, with the host of the game going last.
• On their turn, a player can choose to "stand .. or "roll."
If the player stands, the next player can take a turn. A
player who rolls takes an additional die and rolls it. If the
total of their dice exceeds 21, they "bust" and are out
of the game. Otherwise they can keep rolling additional
dice until they either stand or break.
• After everyone has had a turn, the highest point total
(excluding players who busted) wins the game and
takes the pot.
