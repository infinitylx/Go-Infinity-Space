Will write some periodic posts about implemeting different algorithms. Starts from the very beginning. Main goal is not algorithms itself but learning go. So don't expect much from it. But hope you my dear reader will enjoy it as much as I do writing it for you.

To learn new language one should read, speak, and write in it. When you learn new programming language one should write in it.

To kill two rabbits with one shot I decided to start writing different algorithms from some online courses and books in Go-lang.

I will try to implement some algorithms on weekly bases.

IT IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!
